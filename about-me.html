			<h1>Ik ben Mathieu</h1>
			<p>Hello, my name is Maitheu Brugman. I was born and raised in The Hague, Netherlands. During my early 30s I
				was an art professor for a local college. I loved it at first, but after a while of teaching I realized
				students were not taking art class to actually learn but to get an easy grade. This made me dislike my
				work.</p>
			<p>I was fortunate enough to be offered a job as an Argricutlural Project Manager from a former colleage of
				mine. This lead me to lead projects in Sri Lanka, Yemen, and Kenya. I treasure the time and experience I
				had in Africa and the Middle East.</p>
			<p>Enough about me, more about the artwork. Most of what I like to paint are landscapes. However, I paint
				whatever I feel like. I hope you enjoy what I have to offer.</p>
